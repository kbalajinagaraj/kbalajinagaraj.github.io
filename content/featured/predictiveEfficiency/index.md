This project deals with the predictive efficiency of the car - By predicting the route of the car based on over 60+ input parameters and estimating the route parameters based on the prediction thereby optimising the vehicle energy consumption pattern in a novel second order cone programming algorithms. I have implemented the optimisation framwork in production scale and worked a bit on the route prediction algorithms as a part of the 6 month assignment.
